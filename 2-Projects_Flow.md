# DevOps Project Flow with CI/CD and Automation

## Project 1: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform
**Context**: Before starting the microservices development, infrastructure must be provisioned using **Terraform**. This project focuses on setting up the necessary infrastructure across **GCP** and **AWS**.
- **Tools and Flow**:  
  **GitHub + Terraform + GCP/AWS Infrastructure Setup**

**Explanation**:
1. **GitHub** hosts the Terraform code.
2. **Terraform** provisions:
   - **Network Setup**: VPCs, subnets, and firewall rules.
   - **Compute Instances**: VMs for Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker, and other services.
   - **Kubernetes (GKE)**: GKE nodes for microservice deployments.
   - **Cloud SQL**: Managed MySQL instances for backend services.

## Project 2: Ansible Playbooks for Service Configuration
**Context**: Once the infrastructure is provisioned, the next step is to configure services using **Ansible** playbooks, which automates the installation and setup of Jenkins, Docker, and other required tools.
- **Tools and Flow**:  
  **GitHub + Ansible Playbooks + Jenkins Master/Slave + SonarQube + Docker Installation**

**Explanation**:
1. **Ansible** automates the installation of:
   - **Jenkins Master** and **Jenkins Slave** instances for CI/CD operations.
   - **SonarQube** for continuous code quality checks.
   - **Docker** on all necessary VMs.
   - Additional tools and dependencies required for the project.

## Project 3: Microservices CI/CD Pipeline with Docker
**Context**: After the infrastructure and services are configured, the CI/CD pipelines focus on automating the build and deployment of microservices as Docker containers.
- **Tools and Flow**:  
  **GitHub + Maven + SonarQube + Jenkins Pipelines + Docker Build + DockerHub + Docker Deployment**

**Explanation**: 
Microservices are built using **Maven**, analyzed with **SonarQube**, and containerized using **Docker**. The Docker images are stored in **DockerHub** and deployed as containers.

---

## Project 4: Microservices CI/CD Pipeline with Kubernetes Deployment
**Context**: After containerization, microservices are deployed to **Kubernetes** for orchestration and scalability.
- **Tools and Flow**:  
  **GitHub + Maven + SonarQube + Jenkins Pipelines + Docker Build + DockerHub + Kubernetes Deployment**

**Explanation**: 
Microservices are containerized, stored in **DockerHub**, and deployed to **Kubernetes** clusters for scalability and high availability.

---

## Project 5: Creating Reusable Pipelines with Jenkins Shared Libraries
**Context**: To standardize and reuse pipeline logic across multiple projects, **shared libraries** are introduced in Jenkins.
- **Tools and Flow**:  
  **GitHub + Maven + SonarQube + Jenkins Pipelines + Shared Libraries + Docker Build + JFrog + Kubernetes Deployment**

**Explanation**: 
Jenkins pipelines are modularized using **shared libraries**, allowing reusable code across multiple projects. Docker images are stored in **JFrog Artifactory**, and Kubernetes continues to handle deployments.


---

## Project 6: Kubernetes Deployment with Helm
**Context**: To further streamline the deployment process, **Helm** is introduced to manage Kubernetes applications.
- **Tools and Flow**:  
  **GitHub + Maven + SonarQube + Jenkins Pipelines + Shared Libraries + Docker Build + JFrog + Kubernetes Deployment + Helm**

**Explanation**: 
**Helm** simplifies the management of Kubernetes applications by enabling templating, version control, and rollback capabilities.


---

## Project 7: Automating Kubernetes Administrative Tasks via Jenkins Pipelines
**Context**: This project automates routine **Kubernetes administrative tasks** using Jenkins Pipelines to simplify cluster management.
- **Tools and Flow**:  
  **GitHub + Jenkins Pipelines + Shared Libraries + Kubernetes Admin Tasks**

**Explanation**: 
**Jenkins Pipelines** automate tasks like scaling, resource management, and configuring network policies, allowing for a more efficient management of Kubernetes clusters.



---

## Conclusion:
The entire flow is structured to provide a fully automated, scalable, and reusable DevOps pipeline, starting from infrastructure provisioning (IaC) and extending to application deployment, Kubernetes management, and automation of administrative tasks.
